# TeamD-DonationApp

Meeting Notes:
Friday April 23rd, 2021 9pm
Present: Nick, Alan Eric, Elaine

Discussion:
Nick - Account Page, backend database users setup, claim item, accept/deny offer, finish transaction functionality
Eric - Search page filter & helping Nick with Account Page
Elaine - Chats page, claim item, accept/deny offer, finish transaction functionality
Alan - Search page search bar and functionality

Design changes
- search page display item image and description instead of a grid of items because it's better usability.
- display number of items donated and received instead of making them buttons since the numbers are supposed
to give users a sense of achievement. Leaving them as textviews achieves this goal.
